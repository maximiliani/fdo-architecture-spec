# FDO Architecture Specification

This repository contains the **FDO Architecture Specification**, developed 
and maintained by the **TSIG Working Group** of the **FDO Forum**.

The specification describes the overall architectural model of FDO, 
its core components, their responsibilities, and the interactions between them. 
It is intended to provide a common technical reference for implementers, reviewers, and contributors.

The authoritative rendered version of the specification is published via **GitHub Pages**.

## Scope and Purpose

The purpose of this specification is to:

- Define the high‑level architecture of the FDO system
- Describe the main architectural components and their roles
- Provide a stable architectural reference for implementations
- Support consistent interpretation across different implementations

This document focuses on **architecture and design principles**. 
Protocol details, APIs, and implementation‑specific aspects are covered in separate specifications.

## Document Organization

The specification is organized into logical sections, each 
maintained as an individual source file and assembled for 
presentation on GitHub Pages.

This modular organization is intended to improve 
maintainability and reviewability while preserving a single, 
coherent rendered document.

- The document may evolve over time
- Not all sections may be complete at all times
- Changes are discussed and reviewed through the repository’s issue and pull request process
